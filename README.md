# Practical_Work_II

This is the repository for the Practical Work II.

## Actions (influenced by activity III, IV)

- 1º Added the basic structure to the html file. 
- 2º Added footer and header.
- 3º Added images for content section + I added my CV document, because it does not say that the image folder was only for images. Therefore, I used it to save the CV document. 
- 4º Added content and menu. -- I put at least three essentials items at the bottom: college name, phone number, and job email. However, the email, and phone number are demostratios. Since I would leave them there if this actually was for me applying to a job, or giving someone the necessary information to contact me. 
- 5º Added styles.css file in css folder, index file as link. I used the styles.css from activity III (I will change it after)
- 6º Added about.html page and modify links and styles of the header menu. 

### Other actions:

- Added the contact, degree, fce, net, topic html to the public directory.
- Decided to change the styles.css, therefore I created the styles2.css and used it for all the webpages. Since it does not say that there can be only one .css in the css folder, then I left the styles.css. So I could check back and forth the mistakes, and changes I had to apply. 
- In the about.html I added on the right down corner my only social media account link. Since it was ask to be done -- If you click it, you get inside the social media being able to see the account.  
- Added the .gitignore, the template from GitHub called VisualStudio. 
- 

### Errors:
- When I added the .gitignore from GitHub, I forgot to do the git pull, therefore it gave me an error when doing the git push.
