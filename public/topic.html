                <p>ARPANET (1969): The first network created so the military could communicate. It was set up between university nodes and funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. It later evolved into the Internet.</p>
                <h2>DATES:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1971</strong> The first non-malicious computer virus appeared, called <em>Creeper</em>. As a result, the first antivirus software was created.</li>
                    <li><strong>1978</strong> The first spam incident occurred: an email was sent to promote a company’s product.</li>
                    <li><strong>1986</strong> The Brain virus appeared, created to protect the rights of medical software, despite the existence of pirated copies of legally owned software.</li>
                    <li><strong>1988</strong> The first massive virus outbreak occurred with the Morris Worm, created unintentionally by a student. It infected around 6,000 computers, caused losses of about $96 million, and led to a sentence of three years of probation.</li>
                    <li><strong>1996</strong> Internet access began to be offered on a massive scale. Phone calls would interrupt the connection because both used the same frequency.</li>
                    <li><strong>2000</strong> Hundreds of millions of users were already connected to the Internet, and the ILOVEYOU worm affected around 50 million computers through malicious email attachments, pushing governments and companies to take cybersecurity seriously.</li>
                    <li><strong>+ 2010</strong> Cyber threats escalated significantly with advanced attacks such as Stuxnet, which damaged Iranian nuclear centrifuges, and the rapid growth of ransomware, including WannaCry and NotPetya in 2017, leading to widespread public, corporate, and governmental cybersecurity awareness.</li>
                </ul>
